# Attachment and regeneration parity

This replaces the earlier assumption that Android's attachment and regeneration
flows already matched Desktop. No Hermes backend code, configuration or deployment
was changed.

## QA-018: attachments

Desktop's [attachment uploader](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/b6b53c69a6ed49cb099cf1bfe76b5e6edd718e5a/apps/desktop/src/app/session/hooks/use-prompt-actions/index.ts)
sends remote images using `image.attach_bytes` with `content_base64` and
`filename`. The returned image path identifies a pending image on that live
session. Generic files use `file.attach` and contribute its returned `ref_text`
to the prompt. Desktop's [submit code](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/b6b53c69a6ed49cb099cf1bfe76b5e6edd718e5a/apps/desktop/src/app/session/hooks/use-prompt-actions/submit.ts)
puts file references before the visible message and supplies a question for an
image-only submission.

Android 2.31.8 follows those calls. Accepted images are not uploaded twice when
a later file fails. Their cache remains until submission succeeds, so a new
runtime can upload again. Removing an accepted image calls `image.detach` so it
cannot silently accompany the next turn. Unsent draft records retain the image's
path and owning live session; those fields reset when moving to a new session.

The original text-file content failure remains separate. Current official
[`prompt_attachments.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/b6b53c69a6ed49cb099cf1bfe76b5e6edd718e5a/tui_gateway/prompt_attachments.py)
still stages remote file bytes beneath the profile home attachments directory
and returns an absolute reference when that directory is outside the session's
working directory. [`cli_chat_turn_mixin.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/b6b53c69a6ed49cb099cf1bfe76b5e6edd718e5a/hermes_cli/cli_chat_turn_mixin.py)
expands references with the working directory as the default allowed root.
[`context_references.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/b6b53c69a6ed49cb099cf1bfe76b5e6edd718e5a/agent/context_references.py)
rejects a resolved file outside that root. The current `file.attach` contract
offers no upload destination parameter. Moving the reference before the text
does not make the path accessible. Do not claim that upload acknowledgement
proves file contents reached the model, or replace references with pasted file
contents to hide the failure.

A local fixture ran the unchanged staging, reference-path and path-resolution
functions from that pinned source, supplying only disposable workspace/profile
locations. Uploading a synthetic text file reproduced the exact outside-workspace
exception. An inside-workspace control resolved successfully. This verifies the
path failure independently of Android and makes no claim of a live Desktop GUI
test or a successful model read. The diagnostic script is tracked at
[tools/qa/reproduce_official_attachment_boundary.py](../tools/qa/reproduce_official_attachment_boundary.py). It reads the two linked official Python files from `build/official-desktop-qa`, preserving their repository-relative paths. Download them at the pinned revision above before running `python tools/qa/reproduce_official_attachment_boundary.py`.

## QA-019: regeneration

Desktop's [rewind implementation](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/b6b53c69a6ed49cb099cf1bfe76b5e6edd718e5a/apps/desktop/src/app/session/hooks/use-prompt-actions/rewind.ts)
submits the selected question in the current session and truncates at its saved
user row. Android previously created a child session first. That extra copy
crossed the gateway's live/durable history reconciliation, where the recorded
attachment-bearing reproduction received error 4018. The exact differing
server text has not been established.

Android 2.31.8 regenerates in place. It reads current history, verifies the
selected message, and submits the fresh prompt row with the existing truncation
confirmation flags. Explicit Branch still creates a separate session. A
definite rejection restores the displayed conversation. A lost acknowledgement
uses existing reconciliation and never automatically resends. Unsent drafts
remain untouched.

Desktop rebinds cached survivor row IDs from the submit response. Android instead
refreshes saved history after completion and rechecks fresh history before every
answer action, so it does not need an additional survivor map. Both clients
resubmit the saved text projection without reattaching original image bytes.

## Verification

The image-route regressions failed on the old client. The regeneration regression
failed because Android called `session.branch`. All 71 focused attachment,
draft, queue and answer-action tests pass after the changes. Live verification
and full-suite results are recorded in the [QA ledger](QA_SWEEP_2026-09-13.md).
QA-018 stays open until a content-dependent text-file answer passes. QA-019
requires successful regeneration of the recorded attachment-bearing case before
its live failure can be closed.

Final result: 1,325 unit/widget tests pass after the release-version assertion
was updated, with four opt-in skips. Static analysis is clean. Signed 2.31.8 /
21932 is installed on the phone. Live tests stopped before submission because
the existing QA chats could not be opened, also observed on 2.31.7. Dashboard
authentication/provider checks passed; the session-open failure is unclassified
QA-028 in the ledger. No attachment-content or regeneration live pass is claimed.
