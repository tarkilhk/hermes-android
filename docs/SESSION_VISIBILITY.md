# Chats and automated runs

The profile browser defaults to Chats. Its Chats / Automated / All selector
remembers the selection per connection and applies it to subsequent profiles.

Chats excludes exactly `cron`, `tool`, `subagent`, and `kanban`. Automated
requests those sources; All sends no source restriction. Unknown and custom
sources remain visible in Chats. A parent session ID does not imply automation:
ordinary conversation branches remain visible.

Session listing and full-text search send the same source filters to Hermes,
before the server paginates. Refresh, archive browsing, and loading more rows
retain the selected filter. Changing it invalidates pending list and search
responses. Cached open chats retain their source so an automated run does not
return to Chats through the local cache. Running turns are not interrupted.

Project browsing applies the same visibility rule before paging its loaded
members. The current Hermes project RPC itself excludes cron/kanban and scans
at most 5,000 sessions. The profile-level Automated and All views remain the
place to browse those runs. Activity continues to show background work.

The classification follows Hermes's own
[session recall source policy](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/c8aa5608c24e3636e77c267650c0f1f52e44adb0/tools/session_search_tool.py#L18)
and [session list/search API](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/c8aa5608c24e3636e77c267650c0f1f52e44adb0/hermes_cli/web_routers/sessions.py#L165).
Source labels describe provenance; old scripts using `cli` or `api_server`
cannot always be distinguished from conversations after the fact.

Personal build 2143 preserves the package `com.tarkilhk.hermes.android` and the
existing release signature. Its ARM64 split version code is 21432.
