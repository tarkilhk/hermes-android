# Hermes Android

A personal Android client for a remote [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), focused on finding work, continuing conversations, supervising agents and using their results from a phone.

This is the `tarkilhk/hermes-android` fork. Its current interface and roadmap are independent of the inherited application's UI. Existing code can be reused or replaced according to the selected plan.

## Product plan and research

The [owner-selected product plan](docs/PRODUCT_PLAN.md) is the source of truth for what we intend to build. It records the feature selections, exclusions, incremental work packages and progress. Planned features are not claims about the current app.

The app uses a left hamburger drawer for Chats, Activity, Connections, App settings and Hermes administration. Hermes owns work state; the phone preserves unsent drafts and client-owned follow-up queues, and uses server refresh to recover current history and status. Broad backend administration is a later, small start that can grow. Voice, bots, Cron/messaging/webhook administration, offline history and a general filesystem browser are outside the initial scope.

The [Desktop/Android comparison](docs/HERMES_DESKTOP_ANDROID_FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md) and [source inventories](docs/README.md#research-preserved-for-future-work) preserve the research behind the decisions. The [documentation index](docs/README.md) distinguishes current contracts from historical plans.

## Current implementation

The current connection flow opens `ProfileWorkspaceScreen`, which owns the drawer and the existing chat workspace. Implemented behavior includes:

- Saved connections in the shared app style, password setup, modern dashboard/gateway validation, profile discovery and client-local profile switching.
- Drawer navigation, Activity discovery across profiles, reachable theme/accent/text-size and notification controls, and installed Android version/build in App settings. Hermes administration shows the selected connection/profile, description/SOUL editing, manual access/provider diagnostics, server-recorded profile usage and confirmed one-host backend updates with server progress and outcomes. Activity reports profiles it could not reach.
- Separate profile-owned conversations and running work, with reconnect and server-history refresh.
- Chat-menu supervision of subagents, goal details and background work. Supported controls include targeted subagent Steer/Interrupt, goal Pause/Resume/Clear, loop/heartbeat controls and background-process Stop. Actions wait for server acknowledgement; goal criteria editing remains planned.
- Projects with rename, server appearance and delete controls; recent and pinned chats, paginated unread filtering, Running/Needs input Activity filters, full-text conversation search, Find within the current chat, and an option to include automated chats.
- Rename, pin/unpin, explicit read/unread, archive/unarchive, delete and move-to-project actions with server-side constraints.
- Streaming conversations, horizontally scrollable tables, selectable fenced code with copy/wrap controls, expandable tool activity, server todo snapshots, collapsed reasoning and Stop. Tapped web images open in a zoomable preview with a browser fallback.
- A thin context fuse displays server-reported usage, with estimated/unknown states and live updates.
- Per-chat model and reasoning selection, with searchable, expandable technical-provider groups. Server session settings take precedence over former local model overrides.
- Unsent text and staged attachments survive app restart, scoped to their original connection/profile/chat. An uncertain send retains its draft for checking against server history; it is never resent automatically.
- Message actions and a long press on Send/Stop offer text-only follow-up queues and steering. Queues run in order while the client is connected, remain separate from the current draft, and pause after failed, stopped or uncertain sends. Queued items can be reviewed and removed.
- Dynamic slash-command discovery, aliases, argument completion, skill dispatch, and dedicated current-session actions including steering and identifiable side-question deliveries.
- Saved-message Edit/resend with history-replacement confirmation, one-shot idle Fork, regeneration and answer-version navigation. Version grouping is currently stored locally and is a known mismatch with the planned server-owned behavior.
- Per-chat Outputs finds file/link references in server history. Authenticated file retrieval preserves host/profile/chat ownership, supports text/image previews and shares actual bytes through Android; downloads are capped at 32 MiB.
- Camera/Photos/Files attachment choices and reviewed Android sharing into a chosen connection/profile/chat. Camera returns to the originating draft's review when that destination is still valid. Incoming shares survive restart before destination selection, preserve existing drafts and never send automatically. Launcher quick chat, server-advertised approvals and structured clarification remain. Sudo, secret and vault forms keep credentials out of drafts/history.
- Local completion/input notifications with independent device controls, optional chat titles, a test alert and original host/profile/chat routing, plus configuration restore from the connections screen.

The shell cleanup removed the unreachable legacy screens and navigation widgets, including the old chat UI, Spaces, Cron, Memory, Files and Skills screens. Shared service and contract code remains available where useful for later work; no stored user data was deleted. The [Android source inventory](docs/research/HERMES_ANDROID_FEATURE_INVENTORY_2026-09-11.md) records the earlier baseline. [Shell delivery notes](docs/APP_SHELL.md) describe this change and its limits.

A command appearing in the gateway catalog does not prove correct support for every client or session. Terminal-only, messaging-only and host-microphone commands have platform restrictions. `/yolo` now uses the session's reported state and the session-scoped configuration RPC, including during a running turn. See the [delivery sequence](docs/DELIVERY_SEQUENCE.md) for verification limits.

Remote work and phone notification delivery are separate. The app reloads server history and available execution/pending-input state when a chat is reopened. Local notifications require an active connection; reliable background push remains roadmap work. Pending sensitive requests cannot currently be recovered after process death because the inspected resume contract does not expose them. See the [delivery contract checks](docs/research/MOBILE_DELIVERY_CONTRACTS_2026-09-11.md) for source evidence and live-verification limits.

## Connect to Hermes

The active app requires a modern Hermes dashboard with profile and session APIs and an authenticated Desktop Gateway WebSocket endpoint. It does not fall back to the old unscoped API-only chat flow.

1. Run Hermes on the backend machine and make its dashboard and gateway reachable from the phone, for example on the same LAN or an existing private network.
2. Add a connection with a label and host. The current form defaults to dashboard port `9119`; use the actual port for your deployment.
3. Supply dashboard credentials if required. Advanced fields support a dashboard path prefix, proxy-authenticated access and an explicit Desktop Gateway URL.
4. Save. The app tests profile discovery, gateway connection and session listing before accepting the connection.
5. Select the intended profile and open a chat or project.

Reverse proxies must route both HTTP requests and the WebSocket connection correctly. Gateway authentication is distinct from the model-provider credentials stored on Hermes. If setup fails, check the host/port/path, credentials and server capabilities rather than following the inherited API-key/SSE instructions.

The app's current slash/profile contracts and any separately maintained backend fixes are documented in [slash command support](docs/SLASH_COMMAND_SUPPORT.md) and the [profile design](docs/PROFILE_SWITCHING_DESIGN.md). Do not assume that a newer Android APK supplies a missing server API.

## Version and application identity

Source version on 2026-09-12 is `2.13.0+2162` in [pubspec.yaml](pubspec.yaml). This is the checked-out version, not a claim that a matching public release has been published. Each release is recorded in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), with semantic versions and an increasing Android build number.

- Personal release package: `com.tarkilhk.hermes.android`, labelled Hermes Personal.
- Development package: `com.hermesagent.hermes_android.dev`.
- The inherited upstream package is separate and is not this fork's release identity.
- ABI-split codes derive from the base build number; the current ARM64 split uses `21622`.

The [release plan](docs/ANDROID_RELEASE_PLAN.md) and [build configuration](android/app/build.gradle.kts) document identity, signing and version-code rules. The selected S08 work will expose this client's version/build and update information in the app, separately from the backend version.

## Development

Use an installed Flutter SDK compatible with [pubspec.yaml](pubspec.yaml), Java 17 and the configured Android SDK. The [local build notes](docs/LOCAL_BUILD_SETUP.md) contain environment-specific setup and dated verification results; use the actual checkout path on your machine.

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --debug
```

Device/live gateway checks are separate from the ordinary test suite. Follow the relevant feature's contract document for its opt-in integration tests.

Personal release builds use [scripts/build-personal-release.ps1](scripts/build-personal-release.ps1) and the separate signing identity. Keep signing material outside Git. Complete [CODE_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md](CODE_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md) before a release; do not change signing identity or publish an APK as part of unrelated feature work.

## Main implementation paths

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [lib/main.dart](lib/main.dart) | Saved connections, app wiring, credentials and notification navigation |
| [Profile workspace](lib/core/screens/profile_workspace_screen.dart) | Current conversation UI and composer |
| [Workspace browser](lib/core/screens/profile_workspace_browser.dart) | Profiles, projects, chats, search and Activity entry |
| [Workspace controller](lib/core/services/profile_workspace_controller.dart) | Profile/chat ownership, commands, active work and reconciliation |
| [Profile gateway](lib/core/services/profile_gateway.dart) | Scoped HTTP/RPC operations |
| [Attachment service](lib/core/services/attachment_draft_service.dart) | Staging, validation and upload |
| [Product plan](docs/PRODUCT_PLAN.md) | Selected scope and delivery record |

The older `WorkspaceScreen`, `ChatScreen` and related screens were removed; Git retains their implementation history.
